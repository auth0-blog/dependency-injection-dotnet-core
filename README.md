This repository contains two .NET Core projects showing how to use Dependency Injection in .NET Core:

- `OrderManagementWeb`: an ASP.NET application.
- `OrderManagementConsole:`: a Console application.

The code is not meant to run, but just to support the article [Understanding Dependency Injection in .NET Core](https://auth0.com/blog/dependency-injection-in-dotnet-core).

## Requirements:

- [.NET Core 3.0 or above](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine
